## Introduction

Do you ever forget when you last changed the cat litter, leading to... unpleasant consequences?  Fear not! CatLitter is a mobile app with a Django backend that helps you keep track of litter box changes and avoid those smelly situations.

## Features

**Track Changes**: Easily log the date and time of each litter change, ensuring a clean and healthy environment for your feline friend.
User Accountability: Assign litter box duty to specific users (even roommates or family members!) to avoid finger-pointing and encourage responsible pet ownership.
Photo Verification: Take a picture of the clean litter box during each change for added accountability. (Future ML integration will automatically verify the photo content.)
Simple Interface: Enjoy a user-friendly and intuitive app design that makes tracking litter changes a breeze.
Benefits

**Reduced Litter Box Odors:** No more forgetting about the litter box, leading to a happier home for you and your cat.
Improved Cat Health: Clean litter promotes better cat hygiene and reduces the risk of urinary tract infections.
Peace of Mind: Gain peace of mind knowing exactly when the litter needs to be changed and who's responsible.
Fun and Engaging: Make taking care of your cat litter box a fun and collaborative experience.
Future Work

**Machine Learning Integration:** The app will incorporate machine learning to automatically classify photos and confirm if they indeed depict a clean cat litter box. This will further streamline the process and enhance accountability.
